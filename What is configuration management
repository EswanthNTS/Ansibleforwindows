Without automation, building and maintaining large-scale modern IT systems can be a resource-intensive undertaking and can lead to increased risk due to manual errors. 
Configuration and resource management is an automated method for maintaining computer systems and software in a known, consistent state.


How Configuration Management Works

There are several components in a configuration management system. 
Managed systems can include servers, storage, networking, and software. 
These are the targets of the configuration management system. The goal is to maintain these systems in known, determined states. 
Another aspect of a configuration management system is the description of the desired state for the systems. 
The third major aspect of a configuration management system is automation software, which is responsible for making sure that the target systems and software are maintained in the desired state.

Configuration Management Benefits

The primary benefit of configuration management is consistency of systems and software. With configuration management.
you no longer guess or hope that a configuration is current. It is correct because the configuration management system ensures that it is correct.
When combined with automation, configuration management can improve efficiency because manual configuration processes are replaced with automated processes. 
This also makes it possible to manage more targets with the same or even fewer resources.
